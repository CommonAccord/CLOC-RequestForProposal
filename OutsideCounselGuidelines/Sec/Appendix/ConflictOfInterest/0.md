Ti=Conflict of Interest 

sec=Our outside counsel must not represent a client that has an interest adverse to {Company.Name.Full}, without our advance permission. Prior to agreeing to represent {Company.Name.Full} in a matter, outside counsel must complete, at its expense, a conflict check. The firm must determine that there are no conflicts or potential conflicts of interest with present or former clients of your firm that have not been resolved in writing between {Company.Name.Full} and your firm.  We expect that you will immediately inform {Company.Name.Full} of any potential conflicts that may arise during the course of your firm’s work for {Company.Name.Full}. Should a conflict be discovered at any time after {Company.Name.Full} has engaged your firm and should the conflict result in your firm’s withdrawal from a matter (whether at your, {Company.Name.Full}’s or a third party’s request), you agree to reimburse {Company.Name.Full} for all costs and fees for work that must be duplicated by {Company.Name.Full} as a result of your withdrawal from the matter.
