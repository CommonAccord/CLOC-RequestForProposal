Ti=Dashboard / Metrics

#Note=Suggested for top firms.

sec=Data is powerful.  We know that our outside counsel generates and track a significant amount of data about its clients and the matters on which it works.  On at least a quarterly basis, {Company.Name.Full} asks that each of its outside counsel prepare and send to Legal Operations a dashboard or report of various metrics highlighting the relationship between the parties.  The dashboard should include, at a minimum, the total invoiced amounts across all matters, the timekeepers staffed to matters, and the mix of AFAs provided.  Also, outside counsel should include any other metrics that it thinks would be useful in showing the value of services provided and the effectiveness and efficiency of outside counsel.
