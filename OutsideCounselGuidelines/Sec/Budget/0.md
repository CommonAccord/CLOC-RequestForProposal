Ti=Budgeting, Forecasts and Accruals

1.Ti=Budgets and Forecasts

1.1.sec=Within {Forecast.Submit.Deadline.days} of a new matter being opened in our billing system, outside counsel must submit a detailed budget projecting fees and costs.  Thereafter, at least monthly when submitting accrual data (and more frequently should the matter have a material change in the interim), outside counsel must review each matter’s monthly budget projections and revise the budget if it recommends any adjustments (up or down). Although legal budget projections are often difficult to make with precision, {Company.Name.Full} always needs to know your current reasonable best estimate by month for at least a rolling 12-month forecast.  All budgets must be reviewed and approved by the partner from outside counsel and the lead {Company.Name.Full} attorney responsible for each matter.

Forecast.Submit.Deadline.days=10 days

1.2.sec=When updating budgets, please do not change the current month’s budget (such updates should be reported as accruals).

2.Ti= Accruals

2.sec=We require outside counsel to submit accruals in a timely manner on a monthly basis. Accruals are unnecessary for matters associated with AFAs.  If you are late reporting accruals three or more times in a rolling six-month period, you will credit us back an amount that will start at {AccrualReport.LatePenalty.$} for the third infraction and will increase by {AccrualReport.LatePenalty.Rachet.$} for each subsequent infraction
